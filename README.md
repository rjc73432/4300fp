Group Members: Jay Washington, Ryan Carroll, and Sevda Arjomand 

## Project Description

Project link: http://172.17.152.72/fp/

Home Page (not tied to database): http://172.17.152.72/fp/index.html
This page serves to welcome visitors with an image carousel of Yummers' entrees.
Images were taken from Creative Commons that were hosted on flickr and from 
dailyhayley.com.


Menu page (works in tandem with menus.py): http://172.17.152.72/fp/restaurant.html
On this page, a user can select portions of the menu from a drop down box to see their options for entrees, 
sides, desserts, drinks and specialty items. 
In case the restaurant wishes to expand its offerings, 
it will be simple to add more food to the database as the table is generated dynamically.

The banner that was made for this page was made from canva.com

Driver page (works in tandem with drivers.py): http://172.17.152.72/fp/driver.html
This page allows the user to select an employee and learn more about who their driver is. It includes a short bio as well a field for number of accidents.
This is pulled from our database of employees, and can be easily changed if people are hired or fired in the future.

Drivers API: http://172.17.152.72/fp/api/drivers/ This allows a user to examine all the data for the delivery drivers. Can receive input for specific drivers by id, by appending "/?id=1"
